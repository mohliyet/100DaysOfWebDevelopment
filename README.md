# A Journey in Web Development

## Introduction

Welcome! I'm M. A., an aspiring web developer eager to delve into the world of creating engaging and functional websites. This GitHub repository is my diary, capturing my daily progress and learnings in web development.

## My Learning Path

- **Focused Learning**: Starting my journey with the core principles of web developmentâ€”HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and beyond.
- **Structured Learning via MOOC**: I am currently enhancing my skills through [The Complete Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/), a comprehensive course covering all aspects of web development.

## Projects and Progress

This repository features a series of projects, each marking a new day of learning and development in my web development journey.

### Featured Projects

- [**Day #001** :](Projects/Day_001/) My journey into web development began with foundational steps. On this day, I focused on setting up my programming environment, which included installing a code editor, configuring a local server, and preparing the necessary tools for web development. I also spent time exploring the course contents of [The Complete Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/), which gave me an overview of the topics I would be learning. The initial project of the day revolved around understanding nested lists and indentations in HTML.
- [**Day #002** :](Projects/Day_002/) On the second day, I delved deeper into the fundamental elements of HTML, focusing specifically on anchors, headers, lists, links, and images. This day was dedicated to understanding how these elements combine to form the structure of a web page. The project of the day was designing a  **Simple HTML Birthday Invitation Webpage** . This project allowed me to apply the concepts learned by creating a webpage that effectively used headers for titles, lists for detailing the event, links for additional information, and images to enhance visual appeal. The invitation page was not only functional but also visually engaging, providing practical experience in crafting inviting and well-structured web content.

## Daily Learning Updates

I'm committed to daily learning and consistent growth. In this section, I'll share my daily experiences, whether it's a new concept, a project milestone, or an interesting challenge.

## Future Goals

* **Full-Stack Expertise** : Aim to excel in both front-end and back-end development.
* **Advanced Technologies** : Plan to delve into cutting-edge technologies like Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and serverless architectures.
* **Personal Branding** : Establishing a strong online presence through blogging and contributing to open-source projects.
