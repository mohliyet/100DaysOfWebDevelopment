Welcome! I'm M. A., an aspiring web developer eager to delve into the world of creating engaging and functional websites. This GitHub repository is my diary, capturing my daily progress and learnings in web development.

## My Learning Path

- **Focused Learning**: Starting my journey with the core principles of web development‚ÄîHTML, CSS, JavaScript, and beyond.
- **Structured Learning via MOOC**: I am currently enhancing my skills through [The Complete Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/), a comprehensive course covering all aspects of web development.

## Projects and Progress

This repository features a series of projects, each marking a new day of learning and development in my web development journey.

### Featured Projects

- [**Day #001** :](Projects/Day_001/) My journey into web development began with foundational steps. On this day, I focused on setting up my programming environment, which included installing a code editor, configuring a local server, and preparing the necessary tools for web development. I also spent time exploring the course contents of [The Complete Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/), which gave me an overview of the topics I would be learning. The initial project of the day revolved around understanding nested lists and indentations in HTML.
- [**Day #002** :](Projects/Day_002/) On the second day, I delved deeper into the fundamental elements of HTML, focusing specifically on anchors, headers, lists, links, and images. This day was dedicated to understanding how these elements combine to form the structure of a web page. The project of the day was designing a  **Simple HTML Birthday Invitation Webpage** . This project allowed me to apply the concepts learned by creating a webpage that effectively used headers for titles, lists for detailing the event, links for additional information, and images to enhance visual appeal. The invitation page was not only functional but also visually engaging, providing practical experience in crafting inviting and well-structured web content.
- [**Day #003** :](Projects/Day_003/) Day three brought new challenges and learning opportunities as I ventured into working with directories and managing multiple web pages. The concept of a boilerplate in web development was introduced for the first time. This day's focus led to the creation of two significant projects: a **Portfolio HTML Multi-Webpage** and a  **Resume Multi-Webpage** , the latter being a capstone project. These projects not only solidified my understanding of web page structuring but also provided hands-on experience in creating interconnected web pages. This was a crucial step forward in my journey, enhancing my skills in organizing and presenting web content effectively.
- [**Day #004** :](Projects/Day_004/) On the fourth day of my web development journey, I delved into the intricacies of style sheets and selectors, exploring inline, internal, and external styling methods through a practical project. Transitioning to external style sheets, I experimented with CSS selectors‚Äîelements, classes, ids, and values‚Äîculminating in a comprehensive understanding of how they impact web element styling. The day concluded with a hands-on project, a Spanish color vocabulary, serving as a creative application of the learned concepts. This project not only solidified my knowledge but also showcased my ability to practically implement styling techniques, marking a significant milestone in my web development education.
- [**Day #005** :](Projects/Day_005/) On the fifth day of my web development journey, I delved deeper into the world of CSS, exploring a variety of properties related to colors, font styling, and the CSS box model. While grasping the fundamentals, I embarked on parallel experiments to observe the effects of these properties, gaining valuable insights into the visual aspects of web design. To cap off the day, I worked on an engaging project‚Äîa motivational meme generator. This project allowed me to apply my newfound knowledge and creativity to craft inspiring memes, marking yet another exciting step in my web development adventure.
- [**Day #006** :](Projects/Day_006/) On the sixth day of my web development journey, I delved into the intricacies of CSS, focusing on the vital concepts of specificity and inheritance. These concepts deepened my grasp of how styles are applied to elements, covering key aspects such as position, specificity, type, and importance. Alongside, I learned the power of CSS group selectors, streamlining my ability to target multiple elements efficiently. Exploring the four fundamental element positioning techniques‚Äîstatic, relative, absolute, and fixed‚Äîgave me precise control over element placement, enriching my understanding of layout design. To conclude the day, I applied these concepts by crafting an ideal flag, showcasing my evolving proficiency in CSS. Each step in this web development journey brings me closer to mastering the art of web design and presentation. Exciting times lie ahead! üé®üñ•Ô∏è #WebDevelopment #CSSMagic #DesignSkills üöÄ
- [Day #007 :](Projects/Day_007/) On the seventh day of my web development journey, I immersed myself in the art of designing a responsive website, unlocking the secrets of CSS display and float properties. The day's focus was on responsive web design techniques, including media queries, CSS grid, CSS flexbox, and exploring external frameworks such as Bootstrap. I delved deep into media queries, honing my skills through practical exercises. The highlight of the day was a project centered around crafting a responsive agency website. Although the project posed some challenges, particularly in aligning with the indicated solution, it provided valuable hands-on experience in the world of responsive web design. As I continue on this journey, I look forward to further refining my skills and creating web experiences that adapt beautifully to different devices and screen sizes. üñ•Ô∏èüåê #WebDevelopment #ResponsiveDesign #CSSMagic üöÄ
- [**Day #008**:](Projects/Day_008/) Day 8 of my web development journey seamlessly continued the exploration of responsive web design techniques from Day 7, focusing on flexboxes. After delving into Media Queries previously, I immersed myself in the versatile world of flexboxes, a powerful CSS layout tool. The first activity led me to understand key flexbox properties‚Äî`flex-direction` and `flex-basis`, while also introducing the concept of adding gaps between flexboxes for enhanced design finesse. The second activity took a delightful turn as I played "Flexbox Froggy" on [Flexbox Froggy](https://appbrewery.github.io/flexboxfroggy/), making learning interactive and fun through experimentation with various flex-layout formatting types. The third activity introduced me to flex-sizing fundamentals, enhancing my grasp of controlling the size of flex elements. Finally, I wrapped up the day by applying these newfound skills to create a pricing table project, reinforcing my practical knowledge in responsive web design. With each step, I'm closer to mastering the art of crafting web layouts that adapt seamlessly to diverse screens. üåêüíº #WebDevelopment #FlexboxMagic #ResponsiveDesign üöÄ
- [**Day #009**:](Projects/Day_009/)On the ninth day of my web development journey, I immersed myself in the fascinating world of CSS Grid, the third responsive web design technique in my toolkit. This day was all about mastering the fundamentals of CSS Grid, including grid placements and layouts. To solidify my understanding, I embarked on a captivating project‚Äîa Mondrian project. This project provided hands-on experience in applying CSS Grid techniques to create visually engaging and responsive web layouts. With each day, my skills in web design and responsiveness continue to grow, and I'm excited for what lies ahead on this journey. üåêüé® #WebDevelopment #CSSGrid #ResponsiveDesign üöÄ
